# Async recursive animation
Demo: https://aosanders.github.io/MySite/

Simple transition animation that utlilizes two asynchronous recursive functions.

Wanted to make a transtion animation using recursive functions. However, this was when I first had to deal with JavaScript's asynchronous
characteristics. Learned how to implement callback functions within the recursive functions in order to make them act more synchronous when I needed them to.
